The flavor is one of those handful of reasons why Cold Brew exploded over the last few years, and with ...<br> the first sip , you may think why people didn’t cold brewing coffee ages ago.</p>

                              <p>Wait! Cold Brew isn't the Iced Coffee ? Iced coffee can be any form of coffee - drip, pour-over and even espresso. But cold brew is a specific style of iced coffee or an iced coffee technique. One isn’t better than others; they are made differently and have distinct tastes.  When you ask the barista for a cold brew coffee at a restaurant or coffee shop, you’ll be given out a cup of java gently stirred with iced cubes.</p>

                     <p>In Italian “doppio” means “double” it means you want double shots of espresso. It's extracted using a double coffee filter in the portafilter so you get 60 ml of espresso served in a demitasse cup which is twice the amount of a standard espresso shot, 30 ml.</p>

               <p>At first, it's thought to call “Caffe Americano” but over the years it has been shortened to just “Americano” Even when you request the barista in an American way , you'll still be served with an Italian drink, prepared by diluting the espresso shot with hot water, that’s similar in strength but different in flavor to regular drip coffee.</p>

                  <p>Unlike ristretto , it means “long” because you'll get the espresso drink with much more water , which generally results in a long cup of java . This isn't the quality feature but mainly just the part of personal preference . From my experience, the majority of the coffee lovers order a “lungo” just to enjoy a less intense “espresso” in a cup while still having the taste and attributes of espresso.</p>
